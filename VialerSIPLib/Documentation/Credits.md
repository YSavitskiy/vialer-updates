#### Credits

This project wouldn't exist without the work of others. We love the open source community and what it creates. We want to give a big shout out to the people who inspired us to create this library.

##### PJSIP

What is a wrapper without the code it surrounds? Thanks [PJSIP](http://www.pjsip.org/).

##### Gossip

Our first app used Gossip as the wrapper for PJSIP. The code writting was a big example for our project. Thanks [Gossip](https://github.com/chakrit/gossip).

##### Swig

When we decided to create our own wrapper, we found an other wrapper which was a big help for implementing some parts of our library. Thanks [Swig](https://github.com/petester42/swig).

##### Telephone

We found Telephone when the first part of our library was already written. But Telephone had some nice features we didn't come across in the other wrappers. Thanks [Telephone](https://github.com/eofster/Telephone).
