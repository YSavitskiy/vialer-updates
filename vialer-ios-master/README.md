# Vialer iOS

Vialer is an iOS application that serves as both a VoIP client and a management tool for accounts on the [VoIPGRID](https://voipgrid.nl) platform.

## Open-source

Vialer is designed exclusively for use with VoIPGRID, this repository exists so that our development of the product is open and publicly visible rather than because we want to encourage collaboration.

There are no plans to modify this repository to support other VoIP providers or technologies that aren't relevant to VoIPGRID, if you wish to do so then we would encourage you to fork the repository.

Vialer iOS heavily utilizes [VialerSIPLib](https://github.com/VoIPGRID/VialerSIPLib), a provider-independent Objective-C wrapper around PJSIP where we welcome collaboration and are actively monitoring issues and pull requests.

## Issues

For support, bug reports or feature requests, please contact your telecom provider.
