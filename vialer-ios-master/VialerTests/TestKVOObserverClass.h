 *  This is not possible directly on a NSObject mock because of a known limitation of OCMock.
 *
 *  OCMock 10.6 Methods on NSObject cannot be verified
 *  It is not possible use verify-after-running with methods implemented in NSObject or a category on it.
 *  In some cases it is possible to stub the method and then verify it. It is possible to use
 *  verify-after-running when the method is overriden in a subclass.
